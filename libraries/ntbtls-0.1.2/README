  WARNING: Although this library is based on PolarSSL code it is
  pretty young and NOT WELL TESTED.  There are lot of things missing
  and we release it only to get pratical experience with its use.
  More releases can be expected in the near future.

See the file AUTHORS for copying conditions.  See HACKING for
internals.
